Hello! My name is Maulana Ahmad Aji Triadi, but you can call me Maulana. I'm a software engineer focused on crafting efficient, innovative digital solutions. My experience in web development has equipped me with the skills to build dynamic, user-friendly websites, and I stay updated on the latest tech trends in this rapidly evolving field. Creating engaging online experiences is at the core of what I do.

My interest in technology began in 2006, growing significantly after moving to Yogyakarta, where I joined an online programming community. I started with Visual Basic 6.0, developed a foundation in PHP, and later worked on a social media management system while also exploring blogging.

By 2016, I began applying my graphic design skills, participating in logo design contests, and assisting on various projects. In 2018, I was motivated to participate in a programming competition, where I placed second. Afterward, I attended Amikom University in Yogyakarta, where I completed my thesis on the application of programming methods in a real-world project. Currently, I’m focused on freelance work and expanding my skills in languages like Golang and React. I’m also developing my personal website with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The design is inspired by <a href='https://nevflynn.com' target='_blank'>nevflynn.com</a>.
