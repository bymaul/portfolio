I spent five months using **Surfingkeys**, and while it offered a lot, I’m now back on **Vimium C**. Here's why.

## Why I Switched to Surfingkeys

There was one killer use case: **opening dropdowns with hints**, especially in tools like **Taiga** — specifically the status field. Vimium C couldn’t interact with those properly. Surfingkeys could. That alone made the switch worth trying.

Bonus points for Surfingkeys’ feature set:

- Full JavaScript scripting
- CLI-like interfaces for bookmarks/history
- Custom keybindings for almost anything

Basically, it gave me full control of the browser.

## Why I Switched Back

Over time, that control turned into clutter.

### Too Many Features I Don’t Use

Surfingkeys tries to be an entire platform. I only needed better link hinting — not a terminal inside my browser, not a custom popup renderer, not fuzzy search for bookmarks. Most of the features sat unused, just bloating the config and UI.

### Maintenance Fatigue

Configuring Surfingkeys felt like managing a personal browser extension. Too much overhead for small tweaks. Debugging broken mappings on some websites became a time sink.

### Performance and UX

- Hints were occasionally slow  
- Some keys didn’t register right away  
- On certain SPAs, the hint system was unreliable  

Not deal-breakers on their own, but annoying enough to break flow.

## Why Vimium C Still Wins

After going back to Vimium C, things just felt **fast**, **clean**, and **reliable**.

- Hints are instant
- Config is minimal and intuitive
- Works on 95% of the web out of the box
- No bloat. No weird UI

I can’t open dropdowns in Taiga anymore, but honestly, that trade-off is worth it for how smooth everything else feels.

## TL;DR

Surfingkeys gave me one key feature (dropdowns in Taiga), but buried it under layers of stuff I didn’t need. Vimium C might be simpler, but that’s exactly why I’m using it again.
