I started this project after my friend asked me to create a sales information system for the coffee shop he built. Here, I began learning to use Laravel as the framework for the project. In this project, I used Laravel 10, SB Admin 2 (Bootstrap) as the dashboard template, and jQuery. I also chose this project as the title for my thesis. This project is open-source, so if you're interested in contributing, feel free to fork and submit your pull requests.
